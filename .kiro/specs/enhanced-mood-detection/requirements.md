# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing LED matrix cosplay system by improving the audio-based mood detection capabilities. The system currently has basic mood detection using RMS energy, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid, but needs more sophisticated analysis and tuning to accurately detect emotional states from speech patterns while running efficiently on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cosplayer, I want the LED matrix to accurately detect my emotional state from my voice so that the displayed animations match my current mood and enhance the character portrayal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak in different emotional tones THEN the system SHALL detect at least 4 distinct mood categories (calm, neutral, energetic, excited/angry)
2. WHEN my voice exhibits high energy characteristics THEN the system SHALL switch to energetic or excited mood frames within 2 seconds
3. WHEN I speak calmly or softly THEN the system SHALL display calm mood frames with appropriate visual feedback
4. WHEN there are rapid changes in vocal intensity THEN the system SHALL smooth transitions between moods to avoid jarring visual changes
5. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL maintain mood detection accuracy above 80%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable mood detection parameters so that I can tune the system for different voices and environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load mood detection thresholds from a configuration file
2. WHEN I modify threshold values THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring a restart
3. WHEN calibrating for a new user THEN the system SHALL provide a calibration mode that records baseline voice characteristics
4. WHEN environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt thresholds automatically based on ambient noise levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cosplayer, I want smooth mood transitions so that the LED display changes feel natural and don't distract from the performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mood changes are detected THEN the system SHALL implement a smoothing algorithm to prevent rapid flickering between moods
2. WHEN transitioning between moods THEN the change SHALL occur over 1-3 seconds rather than instantly
3. WHEN the same mood is detected consistently THEN the system SHALL maintain that mood for a minimum duration of 5 seconds
4. WHEN conflicting mood signals are detected THEN the system SHALL use a confidence-based approach to determine the final mood

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance artist, I want the system to work reliably in various acoustic environments so that it performs consistently during different events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing in noisy environments THEN the system SHALL filter out background noise and focus on the primary voice signal
2. WHEN acoustic conditions vary THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust sensitivity to maintain consistent mood detection
3. WHEN multiple people are speaking nearby THEN the system SHALL prioritize the closest/loudest voice source
4. WHEN there are sudden loud noises THEN the system SHALL not incorrectly interpret them as mood changes
